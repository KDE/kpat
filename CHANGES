Sat May  2 13:49:46 1998    Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* replaced all locale->translate with i18n

kapt 0.7.1
	- [Robert Williams] added getHelpMenu()
        - [Robert Williams] added -caption "%c" to kpat.kdelnk

since kpat-0.7  (11/Dec/1997)

	- added "Mod3" game (Rodolfo)
	- added "Freecell" game (Rodolfo)
	- Deck class can now handle any multiple of 52 cards (Rodolfo)

since kpat-0.6

	- new KDE FSSTND compliant
	- depending on display colors sets either a 
	  16 color or high color icon and miniicon
	- fixes for new KConfig

since kpat-0.5

	- fixed the bug in Napoleon (cards not completly drawn)
	- added locale
	- german translation

since kpat-0.4

	- major rewrite of pwidget.(cpp|h)
	- KDE compliant menubar and dialogs
	- kpat now stores preferences (type of game...)
	- window title includes current game type
	- misc. cleanups
	- kpat uses now kfixedtopwidget (similar to ktoplevelwidget)
	- toolbar added (though it does not have many buttons)

	- (hopefully) KDE compliant shortcut keys
	- did a lot of reformatting the sourcecode to make
	  it more readable (had to many empty lines IMHO)
	- pwidget does not decide which sizes to use for
	  the different type of games, now the games itself supply
	  a sizehint (will make it more extendible)
