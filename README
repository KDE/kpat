Hello,

this is the very first release of kpat, the KDE solitaire patience game.

It is an almost unchanged "patience" from Paul Olav Tvete, who uploaded
this stuff some months ago on www.troll.no.

My changes are so far:

    - renamed the stuff kpat-0.1
    - improved drag'n'drop (no more weird jumping of cards)
    - improved look (shaded borders around the cards and piles)
    - hopefully improved cards-background 
    - "very easy"-option for klondike to give only one card. 
    - unset wholeColumn for klondike, but this all belongs into OPTIONS

Anway, kpat is IMO already yet the best X-based solitaire-like game,
thanks to Paul Olav Tvete and Qt :-)


Greets,

  Matthias



----- original README (probably Paul):

This is an implementation of patience (solitaire). It consists of a
general class library and six games implemented using it.

I wrote this program when learning Qt. There are a number of things I
would have done differently now. One of the silliest is that all the
intelligence lies in the cards (which are individual widgets, by the way)
instead of in a Patience class.

There are a lot of static variables. Don't try to instantiate more than one
dealer at a time -- that way lies madness.

The general base classes could doubtlessly have been a lot more general.
