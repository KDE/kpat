Hello,

this is the very first release of kpat, the KDE solitaire patience game.

It is an almost unchanged "patience" from Paul Olav Tvete, who uploaded
this stuff some months ago on www.troll.no.

My changes are so far:

    - renamed the stuff kpat-0.1
    - improved drag'n'drop (no more weird jumping of cards)
    - improved look (shaded borders around the cards and piles)
    - hopefully improved cards-background 
    - "very easy"-option for klondike to give only one card. 
    - unset wholeColumn for klondike, but this all belongs into OPTIONS

Anway, kpat is IMO already yet the best X-based solitaire-like game,
thanks to Paul Olav Tvete and Qt :-)


Greets,

  Matthias
