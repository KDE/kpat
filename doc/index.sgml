<sect>Rules of the game
<p>

<sect1>Klondike
<p>
You know this one. Alternate red and black on the foundations. 
Follow suit on the top. When you click on the deck, three more cards are dealt. 
Simple rules means that excess cards are put on top of the deck, hard rules that they are left on bottom. 

<sect1>MicroSolitaire
<p>
This version of Klondike was popularized by a large software company. 
Alternate red and black on the foundations. Follow suit on the top. 
When you click on the deck, one card is dealt. 

<sect1>Calculation
<p>
This one takes some time to get used to. The objective is to move all cards to the top four piles. 
Unlike most other forms of patience, you do not need to follow suit. 
On the leftmost pile, put the cards in sequence A-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K. 
On the second pile the sequence is 2-4-6-8-10-Q-A-3-5-7-9-J-K, on the third 3-6-9-Q-2-5-8-J-A-4-7-10-K, 
and on the rightmost 4-8-Q-3-7-J-2-6-10-A-5-9-K. 
You may use the bottom piles any way you want, but remember that it is possible to transfer 
sequences as well as single cards to the top piles.

<sect1>Napoleon's Tomb
<p>
The four diagonal piles takes cards of any suit, 
of increasing value starting with 7 and ending up with K. 
The middle pile takes cards of any suit, starting with 6, decreasing down to A, 
and string over again with 6. The remaining four positions are for temporary storage, 
each may hold one card. 

<sect1>The Idiot
<p>
If more than one card of the same suit is exposed, you can remove the lower-valued ones. 
You can move cards to empty positions. The objective is to end up with only aces. 

<sect1>Grandfather
<p>
The objective is to move all cards to the top four piles, 
in ascending order and following suit in each pile. On the foundation, 
you may move a card to the next card of the same suit; 
you may move the five of spades on top of the six of spades, 
even if there are other cards on top of the five of spades. 
When no further moves are possible, click "Redeal". 
The game is over after two redeals. 

<sect1>Ten
<p>
If three cards on the outer edge of one pile sums to 10, 20 or 30, you can remove them. 
K, Q and J count as 10. To remove cards, just click on the pile. 
The objective is to remove all cards. 
If this is too much mental strain, just select "Full Auto" and watch the machine do your relaxation for you. 

<sect1>Mod3
<p>
The objective is to move all cards to the top three rows. 
The first row takes cards starting with 2, the second starts with 3, 
the third starts with 4. The other cards must be of the same suit, 
increasing by 3. In other words, the first three rows takes the sequences 2-5-8-J, 
3-6-9-Q, 4-7-10-K, respectively. You can only place a 8 on the top of a 5 on 
the first row if the 5 is on the top of a 2. The 2 can be placed on an empty 
place of the first row. At each redeal, eight more cards goes to the fourth row. 
Aces don't play. 

<sect1>Freecell
<p>
The objective is to move all cards to the store positions (the four top-right places), 
starting with aces, in ascending order, following suits. 
The free cells (the four top-left places) can hold any -- and just one -- card. 
Alternate red and black (in ascending order) to put cards on the other eight stacks. 
If one of the stacks is empty, any card can be placed there. If there is enough free 
cells you can move multiple cards if they are in the correct sequence and with 
alternate colors. The number of free cells required is the same as if you would make an 
equivalent sequence of moves with single cards.
