Cleaning:
  type Dealer       -->  Patience
  type Card::Value  -->  Card::Rank


TODO: 
      - more options (wholeColumn, etc.)
         kpat already supports a lot, but they aren't accessible via GUI yet
      - implement support for nice (configurable) backgrounds, like
        color gradients, background pixmaps (tiled, wallpaper, etc. ).
      - give feedback in the statusbar if there is no move except draw
	possible. Open a messagebox when no more moves are possible at all.
	(ie. Game Over).
      - separate the dealer and related classed into a library, so
	that other card games can use it.

DONE:
      - preview on cards that are hidden but faceup (RMB)
      - animation when a card moves back automatically
      - nice animation when you win a game
      - game numbers as in MS freecell (thanks Marcus)
      - undo 
      - ambigious place - choose one
      - flip animation
      - dblclick to put cards directly onto the piles.
      - more colorful cards (there are some nice with xpat2)
	same cards as KPoker (shamelessly stolen :-)
      - better scaling (what about a 640x480 resolution?)
      - more options (different backgrounds)
      - kpat still uses the WidgetAt function when dropping cards. That
         means it is not possible to put the hot spot onto the middle of the
         dragged cards what would be better.
