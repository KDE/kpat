TODO: 
      - more options (wholeColumn, etc.)
         kpat already supports a lot, but they aren't accessible via GUI yet
      - counter system similar to MS-Windows. 
      - dblclick to put cards directly onto the piles.
      - animation when a card moves back automatically
      - nice animation when you wan a game
      - kpat still uses the WidgetAt function when dropping cards. That
         means it is not possible to put the hot spot onto the middle of the
         dragged cards what would be better.

DONE:
      - more colorful cards (there are some nice with xpat2)
	Took cards from KPoker (shamelessly stolen :-)
      - better scaling (what about a 640x480 resolution?)
      - more options (different backgrounds)
