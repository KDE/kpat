TODO: 
      - readd set selection
      - scale pixmap sets
      - animation speed factor

DONE:
      - preview on cards that are hidden but faceup (RMB)
      - animation when a card moves back automatically
      - nice animation when you win a game
      - game numbers as in MS freecell (thanks Marcus)
      - undo 
      - ambigious place - choose one
      - flip animation
      - dblclick to put cards directly onto the piles.
      - more colorful cards (there are some nice with xpat2)
	same cards as KPoker (shamelessly stolen :-)
      - better scaling (what about a 640x480 resolution?)
      - more options (different backgrounds)
      - kpat still uses the WidgetAt function when dropping cards. That
         means it is not possible to put the hot spot onto the middle of the
         dragged cards what would be better.
