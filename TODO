TODO: 
      - more options (wholeColumn, etc.)
         kpat already supports a lot, but they aren't accessible via GUI yet
      - preview on cards that are hidden but faceup (RMB)
      - Grandfather's clock, golf, Forthy & Eight

"The kings" (description by David)
 1) Setting up the game:
   Take a king out of the 104 cards
   Put cards on it, face up, until you arrive to the next king
   Do it again, to put all of the 104 cards down
 2) There is room for the 8 aces (usual)
   and for 8 free cards (the player can put cards there when he wants)
 3) Playing:
   The player can mount on aces, move cards to the free area (up to 8),
   and alternate red and black on the foundations.
 This patience is interesting because there's no random (besides the initial
 setup). The player sees everything, and has to think much, to decide when
 it's worth filling the 8 free spaces, making sure he'll be able to empty them
 somehow (on the foundations or on the aces).

     
DONE:
      - animation when a card moves back automatically
      - nice animation when you win a game
      - game numbers as in MS freecell (thanks Marcus)
      - undo 
      - ambigious place - choose one
      - flip animation
      - dblclick to put cards directly onto the piles.
      - more colorful cards (there are some nice with xpat2)
	same cards as KPoker (shamelessly stolen :-)
      - better scaling (what about a 640x480 resolution?)
      - more options (different backgrounds)
      - kpat still uses the WidgetAt function when dropping cards. That
         means it is not possible to put the hot spot onto the middle of the
         dragged cards what would be better.
