<A NAME="klondike"></A>Rules for "Klondike"</H3>
You know this one. Alternate red and black on the foundations. Follow suit
on the top. When you click on the deck, three more cards are dealt. Simple
rules means that excess cards are put on top of the deck, hard rules that
they are left on bottom.

<H3>
<A NAME="microsolitaire"></A>Rules for "MicroSolitaire"</H3>
This version of Klondike was popularized by a large software company.
Alternate red and black on the foundations. Follow suit on the top.
When you click on the deck, one card&nbsp; is dealt.

<h3><a name=calculation></a>Rules for "Calculation"</h3>
This one takes some time to get used to. The objective is to move all cards
to the top four piles. Unlike most other forms of patience, you do not need
to follow suit. On the leftmost pile, put the cards in sequence
A-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K. On the second pile the sequence is
2-4-6-8-10-Q-A-3-5-7-9-J-K, on the third 3-6-9-Q-2-5-8-J-A-4-7-10-K,
and on the rightmost 4-8-Q-3-7-J-2-6-10-A-5-9-K.
<br>
You may use the bottom piles any way you want, but remember that it is
possible to transfer sequences as well as single cards to the top piles.

<h3><a name=napoleons_tomb></a>Rules for "Napoleon's Tomb"</h3>
The four diagonal piles takes cards of any suit, of increasing value starting
with 7 and ending up with K. The middle pile takes cards of any suit,
starting with 6, decreasing down to A, and string over again with 6. The
remaining four positions are for temporary storage, each may hold one card.

<h3><A NAME="the_idiot"></A>Rules for "The Idiot"</H3>
If more than one card of the same suit is exposed, you can remove the
lower-valued ones. You can move cards to empty positions. The objective is
to end up with only aces.

<h3><a name=grandfather></a>Rules for "Grandfather"</h3>
The objective is to move all cards to the top four piles, in ascending order
and following suit in each pile. On the foundation, you may move a card to
the next card of the same suit; you may move the five of spades on top of
the six of  spades, even if there are other cards on top of the five of
spades. When no further moves are possible, click "Redeal". The game is over
after two redeals.

<h3><a name=ten></a>Rules for "Ten"</h3>
If three cards on the outer edge of one pile sums to 10, 20 or 30, you can
remove them. K, Q and J count as 10. To remove cards, just click on the pile.
The objective is to remove all cards. If this is too much mental strain, just
select "Full Auto"  and watch the machine do your relaxation for you.

<h3><a name=mod3></a>Rules for "Mod3"</h3>
The objective is to move all cards to the top three rows.
The first row takes cards starting with 2, the second starts with 3,
the third starts with 4. The other cards must be of the same suit,
increasing by 3. In other words, the first three rows takes the sequences
2-5-8-J, 3-6-9-Q, 4-7-10-K, respectively.
You can only place a 8 on the top of a 5 on the first row if the 5 is on the
top of a 2. The 2 can be placed on an empty place of the first row.
At each redeal, eight more cards goes to the fourth row.
Aces don't play.

<h3><a name=freecell></a>Rules for "Freecell"</h3>
The objective is to move all cards to the store positions (the four top-right
places), starting with aces, in ascending order, following suits.
The free cells (the four top-left places) can hold any -- and just one --
card.
Alternate red and black (in ascending order) to put cards on the other
eight stacks. If one of the stacks is empty, any card can be placed there.
If there is enough free cells you can move multiple cards if they are in
the correct sequence and with alternate colors.
The number of free cells required is the same as if you would make an
equivalent sequence of moves with single cards.
